# FB Library Builder

This repo contains a docker image based off of Ubuntu 16.04 that has all the tools you need to build
binaries with proxygen, folly, or wangle.

Included in the image are a general compiler toolchain as well as tools for generating small docker
containers for binaries built with the container.

Take a look at the Dockerfile and the example for more details.
